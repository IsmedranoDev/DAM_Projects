        <div class="cancion">
          <p>They’re selling postcards of the hanging<br>
            They’re painting the passports brown<br>
            The beauty parlor is filled with sailors<br>
            The circus is in town<br>
            Here comes the blind commissioner<br>
            They’ve got him in a trance<br>
            One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker<br>
            The other is in his pants<br>
            And the riot squad they’re restless<br>
            They need somewhere to go<br>
            As Lady and I look out tonight<br>
            From Desolation Row</p>
          <p>Cinderella, she seems so easy<br>
            “It takes one to know one,” she smiles<br>
            And puts her hands in her back pockets<br>
            Bette Davis style<br>
            And in comes Romeo, he’s moaning<br>
            “You Belong to Me I Believe”<br>
            And someone says, “You’re in the wrong place my friend<br>
            You better leave”<br>
            And the only sound that’s left<br>
            After the ambulances go<br>
            Is Cinderella sweeping up<br>
            On Desolation Row</p>
          <p>Now the moon is almost hidden<br>
            The stars are beginning to hide<br>
            The fortune-telling lady<br>
            Has even taken all her things inside<br>
            All except for Cain and Abel<br>
            And the hunchback of Notre Dame<br>
            Everybody is making love<br>
            Or else expecting rain<br>
            And the Good Samaritan, he’s dressing<br>
            He’s getting ready for the show<br>
            He’s going to the carnival tonight<br>
            On Desolation Row</p>
          <p>Now Ophelia, she’s ’neath the window<br>
            For her I feel so afraid<br>
            On her twenty-second birthday<br>
            She already is an old maid<br>
            To her, death is quite romantic<br>
            She wears an iron vest<br>
            Her profession’s her religion<br>
            Her sin is her lifelessness<br>
            And though her eyes are fixed upon<br>
            Noah’s great rainbow<br>
            She spends her time peeking<br>
            Into Desolation Row</p>
          <p>Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood<br>
            With his memories in a trunk<br>
            Passed this way an hour ago<br>
            With his friend, a jealous monk<br>
            He looked so immaculately frightful<br>
            As he bummed a cigarette<br>
            Then he went off sniffing drainpipes<br>
            And reciting the alphabet<br>
            Now you would not think to look at him<br>
            But he was famous long ago<br>
            For playing the electric violin<br>
            On Desolation Row</p>
          <p>Dr. Filth, he keeps his world<br>
            Inside of a leather cup<br>
            But all his sexless patients<br>
            They’re trying to blow it up<br>
            Now his nurse, some local loser<br>
            She’s in charge of the cyanide hole<br>
            And she also keeps the cards that read<br>
            “Have Mercy on His Soul”<br>
            They all play on pennywhistles<br>
            You can hear them blow<br>
            If you lean your head out far enough<br>
            From Desolation Row</p>
          <p>Across the street they’ve nailed the curtains<br>
            They’re getting ready for the feast<br>
            The Phantom of the Opera<br>
            A perfect image of a priest<br>
            They’re spoonfeeding Casanova<br>
            To get him to feel more assured<br>
            Then they’ll kill him with self-confidence<br>
            After poisoning him with words<br>
            And the Phantom’s shouting to skinny girls<br>
            “Get Outa Here If You Don’t Know<br>
            Casanova is just being punished for going<br>
            To Desolation Row”</p>
          <p>Now at midnight all the agents<br>
            And the superhuman crew<br>
            Come out and round up everyone<br>
            That knows more than they do<br>
            Then they bring them to the factory<br>
            Where the heart-attack machine<br>
            Is strapped across their shoulders<br>
            And then the kerosene<br>
            Is brought down from the castles<br>
            By insurance men who go<br>
            Check to see that nobody is escaping<br>
            To Desolation Row</p>
          <p>Praise be to Nero’s Neptune<br>
            The Titanic sails at dawn<br>
            And everybody’s shouting<br>
            “Which Side Are You On?”<br>
            And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot<br>
            Fighting in the captain’s tower<br>
            While calypso singers laugh at them<br>
            And fishermen hold flowers<br>
            Between the windows of the sea<br>
            Where lovely mermaids flow<br>
            And nobody has to think too much<br>
            About Desolation Row</p>
          <p>Yes, I received your letter yesterday<br>
            (About the time the doorknob broke)<br>
            When you asked how I was doing<br>
            Was that some kind of joke?<br>
            All these people that you mention<br>
            Yes, I know them, they’re quite lame<br>
            I had to rearrange their faces<br>
            And give them all another name<br>
            Right now I can’t read too good<br>
            Don’t send me no more letters, no<br>
            Not unless you mail them<br>
            From Desolation Row</p>
