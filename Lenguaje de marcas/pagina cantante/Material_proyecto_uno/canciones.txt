		Like A Rolling Stone

			<p> Once upon a time you dressed so fine<br>
					s it feel<br>
					How does it feel<br>
					To be without a home<br>
					Like a complete unknown<br>
					Like a rolling stone?</p>

				<p>You’ve gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely<br>
					But you know you only used to get juiced in it<br>
					And nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street<br>
					And now you find out you’re gonna have to get used to it<br>
					You said you’d never compromise<br>
					With the mystery tramp, but now you realize<br>
					He’s not selling any alibis<br>
					As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes<br>
					And ask him do you want to make a deal?</p>

				<p>How does it feel<br>
					How does it feel<br>
					To be without a home<br>
					Like a complete unknown<br>
					Like a rolling stone?</p>

				<p>You never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns<br>
					When they all come down and did tricks for you<br>
					You never understood that it ain’t no good<br>
					You shouldn’t let other people get your kicks for you<br>
					You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat<br>
					Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat<br>
					Ain’t it hard when you discover that<br>
					He really wasn’t where it’s at<br>
					After he took from you everything he could steal</p>

				<p>How does it feel<br>
					How does it feel<br>
					To be without a home<br>
					Like a complete unknown<br>
					Like a rolling stone?</p>

				<p>Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people<br>
					They’re drinkin’, thinkin’ that they got it made<br>
					Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts and things<br>
					But you’d better lift your diamond ring, you’d better pawn it babe<br>
					You used to be so amused<br>
					At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used<br>
					Go to him now, he calls you, you can’t refuse<br>
					When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose<br>
					You’re invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal</p>

				<p>How does it feel<br>
					How does it feel<br>
					To be without a home<br>
					Like a complete unknown<br>
					Like a rolling stone?</p>

	

Ballad Of A Thin Man

 		<p>You walk into the room<br>
                 With your pencil in your hand<br>
                 You see somebody naked<br>
                 And you say, “Who is that man?”<br>
                 You try so hard<br>
                 But you don’t understand<br>
                 Just what you’ll say<br>
               When you get home</p>
               <p>Because something is happening here<br>
                 But you don’t know what it is<br>
                 Do you, Mister Jones?</p>
               <p>You raise up your head<br>
                 And you ask, “Is this where it is?”<br>
                 And somebody points to you and says<br>
                 “It’s his”<br>
                 And you say, “What’s mine?”<br>
                 And somebody else says, “Where what is?”<br>
                 And you say, “Oh my God<br>
                 Am I here all alone?”</p>
               <p>Because something is happening here<br>
                 But you don’t know what it is<br>
                 Do you, Mister Jones?</p>
               <p>You hand in your ticket<br>
                 And you go watch the geek<br>
                 Who immediately walks up to you<br>
                 When he hears you speak<br>
                 And says, “How does it feel<br>
                 To be such a freak?”<br>
                 And you say, “Impossible”<br>
                 As he hands you a bone</p>
               <p>Because something is happening here<br>
                 But you don’t know what it is<br>
                 Do you, Mister Jones?</p>
               <p>You have many contacts<br>
                 Among the lumberjacks<br>
                 To get you facts<br>
                 When someone attacks your imagination<br>
                 But nobody has any respect<br>
                 Anyway they already expect you<br>
                 To just give a check<br>
                 To tax-deductible charity organizations</p>
               <p>You’ve been with the professors<br>
                 And they’ve all liked your looks<br>
                 With great lawyers you have<br>
                 Discussed lepers and crooks<br>
                 You’ve been through all of<br>
                 F. Scott Fitzgerald’s books<br>
                 You’re very well read<br>
                 It’s well known</p>
               <p>Because something is happening here<br>
                 But you don’t know what it is<br>
                 Do you, Mister Jones?</p>
               <p>Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you<br>
                 And then he kneels<br>
                 He crosses himself<br>
                 And then he clicks his high heels<br>
                 And without further notice<br>
                 He asks you how it feels<br>
                 And he says, “Here is your throat back<br>
                 Thanks for the loan”</p>
               <p>Because something is happening here<br>
                 But you don’t know what it is<br>
                 Do you, Mister Jones?</p>
               <p>Now you see this one-eyed midget<br>
                 Shouting the word “NOW”<br>
                 And you say, “For what reason?”<br>
                 And he says, “How?”<br>
                 And you say, “What does this mean?”<br>
                 And he screams back, “You’re a cow<br>
                 Give me some milk<br>
                 Or else go home”</p>
               <p>Because something is happening here<br>
                 But you don’t know what it is<br>
                 Do you, Mister Jones?</p>
               <p>Well, you walk into the room<br>
                 Like a camel and then you frown<br>
                 You put your eyes in your pocket<br>
                 And your nose on the ground<br>
                 There ought to be a law<br>
                 Against you comin’ around<br>
                 You should be made<br>
                 To wear earphones</p>
               <p>Because something is happening here<br>
                 But you don’t know what it is<br>
                 Do you, Mister Jones?</p>





			Desolation Row

			<p>They’re selling postcards of the hanging<br>
				  They’re painting the passports brown<br>
				  The beauty parlor is filled with sailors<br>
				  The circus is in town<br>
				  Here comes the blind commissioner<br>
				  They’ve got him in a trance<br>
				  One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker<br>
				  The other is in his pants<br>
				  And the riot squad they’re restless<br>
				  They need somewhere to go<br>
				  As Lady and I look out tonight<br>
			    From Desolation Row</p>
				<p>Cinderella, she seems so easy<br>
				  “It takes one to know one,” she smiles<br>
				  And puts her hands in her back pockets<br>
				  Bette Davis style<br>
				  And in comes Romeo, he’s moaning<br>
				  “You Belong to Me I Believe”<br>
				  And someone says, “You’re in the wrong place my friend<br>
				  You better leave”<br>
				  And the only sound that’s left<br>
				  After the ambulances go<br>
				  Is Cinderella sweeping up<br>
				  On Desolation Row</p>
				<p>Now the moon is almost hidden<br>
				  The stars are beginning to hide<br>
				  The fortune-telling lady<br>
				  Has even taken all her things inside<br>
				  All except for Cain and Abel<br>
				  And the hunchback of Notre Dame<br>
				  Everybody is making love<br>
				  Or else expecting rain<br>
				  And the Good Samaritan, he’s dressing<br>
				  He’s getting ready for the show<br>
				  He’s going to the carnival tonight<br>
				  On Desolation Row</p>
				<p>Now Ophelia, she’s ’neath the window<br>
				  For her I feel so afraid<br>
				  On her twenty-second birthday<br>
				  She already is an old maid<br>
				  To her, death is quite romantic<br>
				  She wears an iron vest<br>
				  Her profession’s her religion<br>
				  Her sin is her lifelessness<br>
				  And though her eyes are fixed upon<br>
				  Noah’s great rainbow<br>
				  She spends her time peeking<br>
				  Into Desolation Row</p>
				<p>Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood<br>
				  With his memories in a trunk<br>
				  Passed this way an hour ago<br>
				  With his friend, a jealous monk<br>
				  He looked so immaculately frightful<br>
				  As he bummed a cigarette<br>
				  Then he went off sniffing drainpipes<br>
				  And reciting the alphabet<br>
				  Now you would not think to look at him<br>
				  But he was famous long ago<br>
				  For playing the electric violin<br>
				  On Desolation Row</p>
				<p>Dr. Filth, he keeps his world<br>
				  Inside of a leather cup<br>
				  But all his sexless patients<br>
				  They’re trying to blow it up<br>
				  Now his nurse, some local loser<br>
				  She’s in charge of the cyanide hole<br>
				  And she also keeps the cards that read<br>
				  “Have Mercy on His Soul”<br>
				  They all play on pennywhistles<br>
				  You can hear them blow<br>
				  If you lean your head out far enough<br>
				  From Desolation Row</p>
				<p>Across the street they’ve nailed the curtains<br>
				  They’re getting ready for the feast<br>
				  The Phantom of the Opera<br>
				  A perfect image of a priest<br>
				  They’re spoonfeeding Casanova<br>
				  To get him to feel more assured<br>
				  Then they’ll kill him with self-confidence<br>
				  After poisoning him with words<br>
				  And the Phantom’s shouting to skinny girls<br>
				  “Get Outa Here If You Don’t Know<br>
				  Casanova is just being punished for going<br>
				  To Desolation Row”</p>
				<p>Now at midnight all the agents<br>
				  And the superhuman crew<br>
				  Come out and round up everyone<br>
				  That knows more than they do<br>
				  Then they bring them to the factory<br>
				  Where the heart-attack machine<br>
				  Is strapped across their shoulders<br>
				  And then the kerosene<br>
				  Is brought down from the castles<br>
				  By insurance men who go<br>
				  Check to see that nobody is escaping<br>
				  To Desolation Row</p>
				<p>Praise be to Nero’s Neptune<br>
				  The Titanic sails at dawn<br>
				  And everybody’s shouting<br>
				  “Which Side Are You On?”<br>
				  And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot<br>
				  Fighting in the captain’s tower<br>
				  While calypso singers laugh at them<br>
				  And fishermen hold flowers<br>
				  Between the windows of the sea<br>
				  Where lovely mermaids flow<br>
				  And nobody has to think too much<br>
				  About Desolation Row</p>
			  <p>Yes, I received your letter yesterday<br>
				  (About the time the doorknob broke)<br>
				  When you asked how I was doing<br>
				  Was that some kind of joke?<br>
				  All these people that you mention<br>
				  Yes, I know them, they’re quite lame<br>
				  I had to rearrange their faces<br>
				  And give them all another name<br>
				  Right now I can’t read too good<br>
				  Don’t send me no more letters, no<br>
				  Not unless you mail them<br>
				  From Desolation Row</p>
