          <p>You walk into the room<br>
            With your pencil in your hand<br>
            You see somebody naked<br>
            And you say, “Who is that man?”<br>
            You try so hard<br>
            But you don’t understand<br>
            Just what you’ll say<br>
          When you get home</p>
          <p>Because something is happening here<br>
            But you don’t know what it is<br>
            Do you, Mister Jones?</p>
          <p>You raise up your head<br>
            And you ask, “Is this where it is?”<br>
            And somebody points to you and says<br>
            “It’s his”<br>
            And you say, “What’s mine?”<br>
            And somebody else says, “Where what is?”<br>
            And you say, “Oh my God<br>
            Am I here all alone?”</p>
          <p>Because something is happening here<br>
            But you don’t know what it is<br>
            Do you, Mister Jones?</p>
          <p>You hand in your ticket<br>
            And you go watch the geek<br>
            Who immediately walks up to you<br>
            When he hears you speak<br>
            And says, “How does it feel<br>
            To be such a freak?”<br>
            And you say, “Impossible”<br>
            As he hands you a bone</p>
          <p>Because something is happening here<br>
            But you don’t know what it is<br>
            Do you, Mister Jones?</p>
          <p>You have many contacts<br>
            Among the lumberjacks<br>
            To get you facts<br>
            When someone attacks your imagination<br>
            But nobody has any respect<br>
            Anyway they already expect you<br>
            To just give a check<br>
            To tax-deductible charity organizations</p>
          <p>You’ve been with the professors<br>
            And they’ve all liked your looks<br>
            With great lawyers you have<br>
            Discussed lepers and crooks<br>
            You’ve been through all of<br>
            F. Scott Fitzgerald’s books<br>
            You’re very well read<br>
            It’s well known</p>
          <p>Because something is happening here<br>
            But you don’t know what it is<br>
            Do you, Mister Jones?</p>
          <p>Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you<br>
            And then he kneels<br>
            He crosses himself<br>
            And then he clicks his high heels<br>
            And without further notice<br>
            He asks you how it feels<br>
            And he says, “Here is your throat back<br>
            Thanks for the loan”</p>
          <p>Because something is happening here<br>
            But you don’t know what it is<br>
            Do you, Mister Jones?</p>
          <p>Now you see this one-eyed midget<br>
            Shouting the word “NOW”<br>
            And you say, “For what reason?”<br>
            And he says, “How?”<br>
            And you say, “What does this mean?”<br>
            And he screams back, “You’re a cow<br>
            Give me some milk<br>
            Or else go home”</p>
          <p>Because something is happening here<br>
            But you don’t know what it is<br>
            Do you, Mister Jones?</p>
          <p>Well, you walk into the room<br>
            Like a camel and then you frown<br>
            You put your eyes in your pocket<br>
            And your nose on the ground<br>
            There ought to be a law<br>
            Against you comin’ around<br>
            You should be made<br>
            To wear earphones</p>
          <p>Because something is happening here<br>
            But you don’t know what it is<br>
            Do you, Mister Jones?</p>
